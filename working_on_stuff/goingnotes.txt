- persistant storage
- need to figure out orientation how it feeds into the prompt class and associated functions
- need to figure out the system and user thing, like where to put the prompt stuff in classes, like "the following criteria" - does it go in system? or does it live in user?

1. to start backend, create a bash terminal, navigate to backend then run app.py
2. then to get the front end, create a bash, navigate to front end, run npm start
3. instantiate stuff, so like the prompts, user, etc.
    prompt instance, or static instance?
    user instance?
- Help with the prompting
- Help with the prioritization of systems




The idea:
you are well connected and experienced with product management, ux/ui design, software architecture for scalable software solutions, and ceos of successful startups. how would you design the following system:

give me a detailed roadmap for a software app.
the app is meant to help people tell their personal stories
1. back end using flask
2. front end using react
3. takes in text journal entries
4. transforms their data into a cohesive stories that amount to the lore of that person.

It needs traditional user system, where each person has an id and password, where their data is stored with that user id. it needs the ability to record voice. it also needs the ability to transcribe that voice data into text. 

data creation: 
on the bottom data later is the raw entries by the people using the app. 

basic cleaning:
the second layer is a smoothened summary of the users data, so that its easier for future processing by llms. 

data layers that will lead to products:
the third layer would be to summarize across different entries, giving individuals the opportunity to understand the story of their lives across days, weeks, and months. here products can be spin out to the individual user. for instance, one series of prompts could be used to take in the raw data and build sophisticated narratives for the user. This could be a family heirloom (a personal history), something to share with friends (like the annual spotify wrapped). the emphasis will be on the character in a first or third person pov going through their life. from the mundane details of that person's life, challenges that are at the core of narratives (anxiety, challenges) can be extracted and turned into a sophisticated, elevated, and artful illustration. it is, in some ways, a portrait of the person, a vanity. a second product from this layer could be various agents that can engage the user when they wish to have insights into their lives, their personalities, their patterns of thinking. it can be the basis for making incremental change in their lives that leads to greater health and wellness.  What other ideas do you have for products for this particular layer?

in the fourth layer, data in the second and third layer from different users can be combined to synthesize stories that are happening in a group, community, identity, etc. Privacy is of concern, and revealing the private thoughts from one person to another would be strictly forbidden in this fourth layer. additionally, in this fourth layer, it would also be appropriate to create a product that was neutral in tone, as in the style of journalistic content. This layer would output products related to those groups. this would be more like a jouranlist, a historian, a lore master, and archivist. from here we could have suggestions for what those communities could focus on next, given the details of what's going on in everyone's lives.

a 5th layer could be built upon the 4th layer, giving a history for states, nations or the globe. an additional product could, similarly to past layers, be something that suggests things to do next, or at the very least gives insights into what's going on.

the data in each of these layers can be fed back into the products in lower levels, to help contextualize that person's life. For instance, the global narrative from the 5th layer or the narrative of their community in the 4th layer could be fed into the story of the lives of the person in the 3rd layer. the ai can identify how these things are affecting the person and tell it through a narrative.

For instance, take the book 1984 by George Orwell. The main character is influenced by macro events like the war between Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. it plays a critical role into the protagonists experience and presents challenges for  him to grow through, including the role of constant surveilance by technology and the inherent suspicion between people that that brings between characters. The story, however, does not talk about the wars themselves: the battles, the logistics, the influential generals and their tactics, etc. instead it offers a backdrop/setting for the man who is navigating the effects this type of dystopian society has had on him. 

for some, a story told about themselves from a different perspective or style could provide them insights, alone. it can inspire them to see outside the matrix they live in and perhaps be inspired to make changes that are for the betterment of their wellbeing, health, and their society's.

what i need help with is the blueprint or software architecture that can build this type of system.

7. Future Opportunities & Product Expansion

    AI-Driven Coaching / Therapy Adjacent (Not a replacement for professional help)
        Provide advanced “therapy simulation” or “life coach” suggestions (with disclaimers), building on a user’s personal data history.

    Social Sharing
        Users might choose to share certain summaries or “chapters” with friends or family.
        Could incorporate feedback loops or collaborative journaling experiences.

    Integration with Wearables
        Correlate user’s psychological states with physical data (heart rate, sleep patterns). Over time, produce more holistic personal insights.

    Enterprise Use
        A version for corporate teams or organizations to track morale, reflections, or project retrospectives. Summaries can inform management about the “health” of the team.

    Educational Market
        Students reflecting on progress, teachers analyzing anonymized student writing patterns, etc.



   1.24.2025
   So I have the basic skeleton of a auth service. I probably need to add in something for forgetting a password.
   
   Additional Security Considerations:
      Implement rate limiting for login attempts
      Add CORS protection
      Set secure cookie flags
      Implement password reset functionality
      Add email verification
      Use HTTPS in production
      Implement refresh tokens
      Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show how to implement any additional security features?

   RE: routes.py
      These additions provide:
         Password reset functionality
         User profile management
         Session management (logout)
         Token refresh mechanism
         Email verification
         Protected routes using JWT
      Remember to:
         Add appropriate error handling
         Implement rate limiting for sensitive routes
         Add validation for user inputs
         Set up email service for password reset and verification in production
         Add logging for security events
         Consider adding 2FA routes if needed
         Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features or show how to implement additional security measures?
